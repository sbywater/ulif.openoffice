CHANGES
*******

1.1.1 (2015-07-23)
==================

* Close file handles properly.

* The commandline client now only handles one input file and does not
  copy whole directory contents any more.


1.1 (2015-07-12)
================

* Added a WSGI-based XMLRPC application to trigger conversion via
  XMLRPC.

* Added `get_cached` method for client and XMLRPC client to retrieve
  docs stored in cache.

* Added `get_cached_file_by_source` method for cachemanager. This method
  is expensive but allows finding cached files without a cache key.

* Fixed bug: OOCP processor returned wrong result file path for XHTML
  output.

* Fixed bug: Remove temporary dir if converting fails in client.

* Modified tests to accept also docs generated on Ubuntu 14.04.

* Fixed bug: Catch shutil.Error in copytree() [thanks to: sbywater]

* Added new option: `--css-cleaner-prettify-html` prettifies generated
  HTML code. This was done automatically  in previous releases and can
  lead to gaps in rendered output. This option, when set (disabled by
  default) enables the old behaviour. Fixes #3.


1.0 (2013-09-02)
================

Major rewrite of the whole package.

* `convert` now uses the commandline tool `unoconv`. You need this
  tool to use the package.

* As `unoconv` has all you want from the package script `convert` (and
  much more!), the `convert` script is not provided as a script any
  more. Simply use `unoconv` instead.

* `oooctl` is now a daemonizer for ``unoconv -l``.

* Apply PEP 8 rules to cachemanager.py.

* Moved unittests to dedicated ``tests/`` dir in package root.

* Switched from Zope testing to `py.test`.

* Removed `pyuno` server, clients and related components.

* Removed `find` functionality as it is based on direct `pyuno` access.

* Removed `zc.buildout` support.

* Removed cherrypy-based restserver. The new WSGI app is the replacement.

* Added WSGI based document converter.

* Added simple htaccess WSGI filter for web authentication.

* Replaced cachemanager with a more robust and lightweight
  version. Old caches do not work any more with this new
  implementation.

* Introduced a new central `Options` component to manage supported
  options for all other components.

0.4 (2011-02-11)
================

* Added functionality to find text in documents. Many thanks to sig at
  akasig.org for the patch!

0.3 (2010-11-17)
================

* Added option to disable caching completely: set ``--cache-dir`` to
  empty string to disable caching [Thanks to Adama Groszer for
  patches!]

* Removed unwanted output when running in foreground mode.

* Cachemanager now supports listing all sources contained in cache
  dir.

* Fixed bug in cachemanager: under rare circumstances (two different
  input files with same MD5 hash digest *and* identical file stats
  were considered to be identical by the cachemanager and thus led to
  inconsistencies in cache). We now check thoroughly whether two such
  files differ.

* Lots of test fixes [Thanks to Adam Groszer for patches!]

0.2.1 (2010-06-13)
==================

* Fixed fix to cope with pyuno monkey-patching standard __import__
  function. More recent pyuno versions do not do that kind of stuff
  any more (which is an improvement).

* Fixed foreground start of ```oooctl``` server. It didn't work
  correctly with more recent OpenOffice.org/pyuno installs. You now
  don't have to press CTRL-C two times anymore when trying to stop a
  oooctl server running in foreground.


0.2 (2010-05-20)
================

* Added license and copyright file to comply with policy of major
  Linux distributors.

* Added sphinx docs.

* Fixed wrong result path when returning cached HTML results.

* Added mode ``fg`` for ``oooctl``. Using ``oooctl fg`` one can start
  ``oooctl`` in foreground now.

* Added mode ``fg`` for ``pyunoctl``. Using ``pyunoctl fg`` one can start
  ``pyunoctl`` in foreground now.

* Added state check for ``oooctl``: when OpenOffice.org server is down
  during runtime it is restarted automatically. The check happens
  every second.

* Use standard lib `doctest` instead of `zope.testing.doctest`.

* Changed PDF creation: by default now normal PDF (and not PDF/A) is
  created when converting to PDF. This is due to an endianess bug in
  many recent OpenOffice.org binaries running on 64-bit platforms.

0.1 (2010-03-02)
================

* Initial implementation.
